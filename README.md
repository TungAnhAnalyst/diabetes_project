\# Diabetes Project



A data science project to explain the effect of lifestyle factors on diagnosed diabetes cases.



\## Project Overview



This repository contains code, data, notebooks, and reports related to the analysis and modeling of diabetes diagnosis using clinical and lifestyle predictors. The goal is to understand relationships between predictors (e.g., age, BMI, smoking) and the binary outcome of diagnosed diabetes, and to build a logistic regression model that predicts diagnosis risk.
