Diabetes Project
==============================

A data science project analyzing the relationship between lifestyle factors and diagnosed diabetes.

Project Overview
------------

This repository contains code, data, notebooks, and reports for exploring and modeling diagnosed diabetes using clinical and lifestyle predictors such as age, BMI, and smoking status. The primary objective is to understand key risk factors and build an interpretable logistic regression model to estimate the probability of diabetes diagnosis.
